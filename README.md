Idea for BIS:

#### Rogue Gameplay
1. create empty room inside map
2. add player and control via keyboard
3. add food and collect with player
4. add enemy prefab and script -> place in room
5. add enemy movement -> follow the player
6. add random map 
7. dark room (nice to have)

#### Game Sounds

1. sound (application with a blind scene -> just audio output) -> different branche
2. add walking sound to handle
3. add soundmanager to game

8. room speech on entry -> SpeechIO???

#### DualPanto Haptics

1. add unity handle to game -> move to position, move around with unity handle
2. add player recoil when player collides with enemy



Extra todo:
- move plane to 0,0
