Idea for BIS:

1. build a game with toolkit but without dualPanto included -> use keys to move (just one room)
2. add food and enemy
3. add enemy movement -> follow the player
4. add unity handle to game -> move around with unity handle
5. add walking sound to handle
6. add soundmanager to game
7. add player recoil when player collides with enemy
-- switch branch to branch with room manager
7. room speech on entry -> SpeechIO???
